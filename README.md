# ![rtkrcv_ros_icon](rtkrcv_ros/figures/rtkrcv_ros_icon.jpg) RTKRCV_ROS 

ROS translation of the RTKRCV - a real-time GNSS precise positioning application included in the RTKLIB package. 

New features include ROS topic publishing of output solutions. The inclusion of a new velocity output format. A new ROS service offers control over the RTK server.

  - All existing output solution formats can be published in ROS.
  - All previous output devices (TCP, files, serial,...) are still available.
  - Fully configurable outputs, as in the original RTKRCV.
  - Configuration continues to be made through the configuration file.
  - Possibility of choosing custom ROS topic and node names.
- New velocity output solution format.
- ROS service to receive control commands.
- New synchronization between rover and base observations to improve moving-baseline solutions.
