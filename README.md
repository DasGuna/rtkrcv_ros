# RTKRCV_ROS

Translation of the RTKRCV to the ROS environment. The RTKRCV, part of the RTKLIB suite, is a standalone command line application for real-time GNSS precise positioning. The RTKRCV_ROS incorporates ROS features seamlessly, to not intefere with the operating mode and configuration options of the original RTKRCV.

The RTKRCV_ROS includes ROS output publishing, a new velocity output format, ROS service control over the RTK server and a new observation synchronization method. All configurations are made through the configuration file. Several configuration file examples are provided.
